The merchant data and connection settings are provided by Moldova Agroindbank. This data is used by the plugin to connect to the Moldova Agroindbank payment gateway and process the card transactions. Please see [www.maib.md](https://www.maib.md) and contact [cards@maib.md](mailto:cards@maib.md) for details.
