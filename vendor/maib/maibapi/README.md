INTRODUCTION
============

The MAIB Payment PHP SDK is used to easily integrate the MAIB Payment into your project.
Based on the Guzzle Libraries to connect and process the requests with the Bank server and the Monolog library to log the requests responses.

The MAIB Payment PHP SDK has 2 ways of payment.
 * One way is SMS Transaction (registerSmsTransaction). When the client's money transfers on the merchant account instantly when the user do the payment. This way is recommended use.
 * Another way is DMS Transaction (registerDmsAuthorization). When the client's money has been blocked on their account before you confirm that transaction. This way is mostly used in the case of the long shipping time.

That Payment PHP SDK includes 6 methods to process the payments:
 * Registering transactions.
 * Registering DMS authorization.
 * Executing a DMS transaction.
 * Get transaction result.
 * Transaction reversal.
 * Close the work day.


REQUIREMENTS
============

 * PHP: >=7.1.0
 * guzzlehttp/guzzle: ~6.0
 * guzzlehttp/guzzle-services: ~1.0
 * monolog/monolog: ^2.7


INSTALLATION
============

 * Run  `composer require maib/maibapi ^2.0`


BEFORE USAGE
============

To initiate an payment transaction you need to obtain the SSL certificate, to get the access by IP and to set the callback URL.
 * Need to write an email to maib commerce support: ecom@maib.md with the request including The Merchant IP and callback URL, to receive access and certificate for testing.
 * When you get the certificate, you need to generate the private and the public keys, using the terminal package OpenSSL
    - openssl pkcs12 -in 0149583.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem
    - openssl pkcs12 -in 0149583.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out pcert.pem
    - openssl pkcs12 -in 0149583.pfx -cacerts -nokeys -out cacert.pem
 * Need to save the generated keys into map on server to usage in the requests.

USAGE
=====
 * Need to include all libraries

 * Prepare the payment parameters
  ````
    // The Parameters required to use MaibClient methods
    $amount = 1; // The amount of the transaction

  ````
 * Registering SMS transactions
   The SMS transaction has 2 steps.
      - The first step is to register the transaction on the Maib Server and obtain the TRANSACTION_ID using the registerSmsTransaction Method.
      - The second step is the redirected user to the Maib Payment Gateway URL using the TRANSACTION_ID.
      * When the transaction has been finalised, the Maib Payment Gateway redirects the user to your callback URL where you get the transaction status.
      ! The TRANSACTION_ID has a timeout of 10 minutes.

      - Required parameters:
        * $amount = 1; // The amount of the transaction
        * $currency = 978; // The currency of the transaction - is the 3 digits code of currency from ISO 4217
        * $clientIpAddr = '127.0.0.1'; // The client IP address
        * $description = 'testing'; // The description of the transaction
        * $lang = 'en'; // The language for the payment gateway
      - Response:
        return array  TRANSACTION_ID

 * Registering DMS authorization
   The DMS transaction has 3 steps.
      - The first step is to register the transaction on the Maib Server and obtain the TRANSACTION_ID using the registerDmsAuthorization Method.
      - The second step is the redirected user to the Maib Payment Gateway URL using the TRANSACTION_ID.
      * When the transaction has been applied, the Maib Payment Gateway redirects the user to your callback URL where you get the transaction status.
      - The third step is to confirm transactions using the makeDMSTrans method.

      - Required parameters:
        * $amount = 1; // The amount of the transaction.
        * $currency = 978; // The currency of the transaction - is the 3 digits code of currency from ISO 4217.

TROUBLESHOTING
==============

All transactions are considered successful it's only if you receive a predictable response from the maib server in
the format you know. If you receive any other result (NO RESPONSE, Connection Refused, something else) there
is a problem. In this case it is necessary to collect all logs and sending them to maib by email: ecom@maib.md, in
order to provide operational support. The following information should be indicated in the letter:
- Merchant name,
- Web site name,
- Date and time of the transaction made with errors
- Responses received from the server
